About three years ago, I had                        the @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyName screening and they found a very                        mild blockage in one of my carotid arteries – nothing to worry about. During a subsequent                        HealthFair screening I went to recently, the team found one of my carotid arteries                        was now more than 90 percent blocked and said I should go to the emergency room.                        I couldn''t believe they were talking about me. Two days later I was having bypass                        surgery on my carotid artery.

As a result of my                        last screening test, I am still alive. The reason that I originally signed up was                        that I had a feeling that “something” was not right. I went to my screening and                        after running the tests, the tech gave me a slip of paper and told me to see my                        physician ASAP. I asked if it could be postponed until next week, but she told me                        that tomorrow would not be too soon. So I immediately sought out my doctor and I                        found out that one of my carotid arteries was 97% blocked. I had surgery within                        a day, and the surgeon told me that it was basically totally blocked and that I                        was lucky. So to say that I appreciate what HealthFair means to me is beyond appreciation.                        <br />                        <br />                        -Tom Schmidt,<br />                        Tampa, FL                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td>                        <hr style="border: solid 1px #000000;" />                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td class="normaltxt_pw" style="font-size: 12px;">                        &copy; <a target="_blank" href="@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.PrivacyPolicyUrl">                            Privacy Policy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.TermsConditionsUrl">                                Terms of Service</a>                        <br />                        Reminder: @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyName will never ask for your                        password or creditcard number in an email.<br />                        <br />                        This email was sent by @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyName because you                        or someone on your behalf registered online at <a target="_blank" href="@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.SiteUrl">                            @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.SiteUrl.</a>                        <br />                        <br />                        <b>@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyName</b><br />                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.StreetAddressLine1<br />                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.StreetAddressLine2<br />                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.City, @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.State&nbsp;                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.ZipCode<br />                        <span style="color: Blue;">@Model.AnnualReminderPhoneTollFree</span> (Toll free)                        <br />                        <br />                        <b>THIS IS AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE</b> - PLEASE DO NOT REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS EMAIL.

I scheduled an appointment early in the morning and am                        so glad I went because the technician found an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm that was                        5.4 cm!                        <br />                        <br />                        Not even six weeks later I was in surgery.

I''m so glad and lucky that I went to HealthFair, or I would have never known I                        had this problem.

About three years ago, I had                        the HealthFair screening and they found a very mild blockage in one of my carotid                        arteries – nothing to worry about. During a subsequent HealthFair screening I went                        to recently, the team found one of my carotid arteries was now more than 90 percent                        blocked and said I should go to the emergency room. I couldn''t believe they were                        talking about me. Two days later I was having bypass surgery on my carotid artery.                        Funny thing was that I thought I was asymptomatic until I woke up from the surgery                        and thought, ‘Where did all this energy come from?’ I tell EVERYBODY – you need                        to have a HealthFair screening test--they saved my life!"                        <br />                        <br />                        - Barbara K. | West Palm Beach, FL                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td>                        <hr style="border: solid 1px #000000;" />                    </td>                </tr>                <tr>                    <td class="normaltxt_pw" style="font-size: 12px;">                        &copy; <a target="_blank" href="@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.PrivacyPolicyUrl">                            Privacy Policy</a> and <a target="_blank" href="@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.TermsConditionsUrl">                                Terms of Service</a>                        <br />                        Reminder: @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyName will never ask for your                        password or creditcard number in an email.<br />                        <br />                        This email was sent by @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyName because you                        or someone on your behalf registered online at <a target="_blank" href="@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.SiteUrl">                            @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.SiteUrl.</a>                        <br />                        <br />                        <b>@Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyName</b><br />                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.StreetAddressLine1<br />                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.StreetAddressLine2<br />                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.City, @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.State&nbsp;                        @Model.EmailCommunicationBaseInfo.CompanyAddress.ZipCode<br />                        <span style="color: Blue;">@Model.AnnualReminderPhoneTollFree</span> (Toll free)                        <br />                        <br />                        <b>THIS IS AN AUTOMATED MESSAGE</b> - PLEASE DO NOT REPLY DIRECTLY TO THIS EMAIL.
